            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Satvik! A graduate student pursuing my Masters of Science in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. My primary passion lies in the field of artificial intelligence, and I've gained hands-on experience in various AI subfields, including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning Models, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. Beyond academics, I'm an ardent chess player and gamer, a movie and TV show aficionado, and a dedicated follower of K-pop, with a special admiration for Nancy Jewel McDonie. I also have a penchant for exploring new culinary experiences, always eager to try new foods. When I'm not indulging in gastronomic adventures, you'll often find me on the open road, enjoying the thrill of riding motorcycles. These diverse interests complement my academic journey, contributing to a well-rounded and fulfilling life. I love to explore new design trends and technologies.</p>

                Developed a program for Virtual Paint which takes live input from the camera feed.
                Detects colors (RGB) while painting on the screen as the colors move in front of the camera. 
                Tech Stack: OpenCV, Python, Mediapipe
